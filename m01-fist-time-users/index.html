<h2 id="module-introduction">Module Introduction</h2>
<p>In this section we&rsquo;ll guide you through a sequence of steps to run a sample application already configured for Contrast Security.</p>
<p>This sequence will help you see the advantages of running an application with IAST built-in, because the more you exercise these applications, the more data we collect representing true execution of your code.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll also show you how to exercise some exploits to observe how Contrast Security protects your  applications.</p>

<h3 id="sample-application---webgoat">Sample application - WebGoat</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;ll start by deploying a vulnerable Java application named WebGoat.  This is a Java open-sourced example designed to helped explain common vulnerabilities as identified by the OWASP Foundation.</p>
<p>At Contrast Security, we place emphasis on <em>instrumenting</em> software to help teams get better results faster as part of their DevOps pipelines.  In this module, you will see the benefits of seeing these results faster.</p>

<p>The application for this module is available at <a href="https://github.com/Contrast-Security-OSS/WebGoat_BBP_FORK">https://github.com/Contrast-Security-OSS/WebGoat_BBP_FORK</a> but we&rsquo;ve already built and instrumented the code to get us a working environment faster.</p>
<p>In later modules, we&rsquo;ll walk you through the process of instrumenting an application.</p>
</section><section>
<h3 id="deploying-your-application">Deploying your application</h3>
<p>This workshop is designed to have you deploy an application so you can see its data added as part of an onboarding lifecycle.</p>
<p>Your instructor deployed applications configured with your TeamServer credentials and will supply connection details for your applications as a URLs for each vulnerable application.</p>
</section><section>

<aside class="notes"><p>For many users, collecting data as we use the application is a brand-new concept.  Most users are familiar with static code analysis and its outcomes, fewer have been exposed to the more modern approach of IAST.</p>
</aside>
<p>Contrast Security collects information as soon as you run your registered application.  The more you exercise the application with manual or automated tests, the more data we&rsquo;ll report.</p>
<p>You will see evidence of this data collection as you use your application that reveals exploits <em>even though you weren&rsquo;t testing for those cases.</em></p>

<aside class="notes"><p>Explain SQL Injection to new users and then show the process.</p>
</aside>
<p>SQL Injections are a flaw that allow an attacker to send extra, untrusted data to a query.  The result is an attacker can run unintended extra commands.</p>
<p>Injections are the #1 Web Application Security Risk in the OWASP Top-Ten.</p>

<h3 id="webgoat-expose-a-sql-injection-vulnerability">WebGoat: Expose a SQL Injection Vulnerability</h3>
<p>The <em>String SQL Injection</em> page is an example of the content in WebGoat.  Their content provides instructions, data-entry exercises, and usually a challenge.  Some challenges include hints and solutions.</p>
<p>Enter your name in the text field (or <code>Smith</code>) and press the <code>Go!</code> button.</p>
<p>You will see a response indicating, <code>No results matched.  Try again.</code></p>
<p>This is a typical data-entry test.  Normal scanning and user testing do not reveal security vulnerabilities on this page, but Contrast Security will.  Let&rsquo;s examine the results from Contrast Security.</p>

<h3 id="what-happens-when-you-deploy-an-application">What happens when you deploy an application?</h3>
<p>When you deploy your instrumented application, a few things happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>The agent connects with the Contrast Server (TeamServer)</li>
<li>The agent starts sending data for the application</li>
<li>If licenses are available, details for the application are visible in TeamServer</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we&rsquo;ll look at the Contrast Security User Interface running on TeamServer.</p>
</section>

<h2 id="introduction-to-teamserver">Introduction to TeamServer</h2>
<p>There are several options to observe information about vulnerabilities in Contrast Security:</p>
<ul>
<li>The browser User Interface (UI)</li>
<li>Programmatic/Command-Line (CLI) API access</li>
<li>Via various integrations (Jira, Slack, IDEs, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>In this module we&rsquo;ll focus on the UI.</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>Instructor: You may have to allocate licenses to users.</p>
<p>This section examines the details for a single exploit.
Explain how the look-and-feel is consistent, and the information is designed to help the developer quickly identify the vulnerability with the specific data supplied to the application.</p>
<p>The Details page shows the path of our vulnerability.  This is an improvement beyond the URL, because Contrast also shows how the vulnerability affects running code.</p>
</aside>
<p>Notifications are useful when first onboarding an application or first uncovering a vulnerability.</p>
<p>At Contrast, we&rsquo;ve learned that as teams shift more of their workload to ephemeral and cloud-based environments, automatic onboarding is a valuable time-saver.  This automatic registration lets teams automatically opt into a security model.</p>
<p>As you and your teams exercise more of your software, we&rsquo;ll keep track of new vulnerabilities as soon as they are discovered.  There is high value to all members of your team when you can leverage this information with minimal configuration.</p>
</section><section>

<p>Everyday Contrast users will go straight to the critical vulnerability from the notification page.  We will navigate through Applications to see more about Contrast Security.</p>
