<h2 id="module-introduction">Module Introduction</h2>
<p>In this section we&rsquo;ll guide you through a sequence of steps to run a sample application already configured for Contrast Security.</p>
<p>This sequence will help you see the advantages of running an application with IAST built-in, because the more you exercise these applications, the more data we collect representing true execution of your code.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll also show you how to exercise some exploits to observe how Contrast Security protects your  applications.</p>
</section><section>
<h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Learn the basics of application security</li>
<li>Gain familiarity with Contrast Security Assess</li>
<li>Exercise tests to expose additional vulnerabilities</li>

<p>This module should take about 45 minutes to complete.</p>
<p>Be sure to have completed the <a href="../#/setup-and-prerequisites">prerequisites</a></p>
</section><section>
<h3 id="sample-application---webgoat">Sample application - WebGoat</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;ll start by deploying a vulnerable Java application named WebGoat.  This is a Java open-sourced example designed to helped explain common vulnerabilities as identified by the OWASP Foundation.</p>
<p>At Contrast Security, we place emphasis on <em>instrumenting</em> software to help teams get better results faster as part of their DevOps pipelines.  In this module, you will see the benefits of seeing these results faster.</p>
</section><section>
<h3 id="building-and-instrumenting-code">Building and instrumenting code</h3>
<p>The application for this module is available at <a href="https://github.com/Contrast-Security-OSS/WebGoat_BBP_FORK">https://github.com/Contrast-Security-OSS/WebGoat_BBP_FORK</a> but we&rsquo;ve already built and instrumented the code to get us a working environment faster.</p>
<p>In later modules, we&rsquo;ll walk you through the process of instrumenting an application.</p>
</section><section>
<h3 id="deploying-your-application">Deploying your application</h3>
<p>This workshop is designed to have you deploy an application so you can see its data added as part of an onboarding lifecycle.</p>
<p>Your instructor already deployed applications configured with your TeamServer credentials.  You will receive the connection details for your applications as a URLs for each vulnerable application.</p>
</section><section>
<h3 id="what-happens-when-you-deploy-an-application">What happens when you deploy an application?</h3>
<p>When you deploy your instrumented application, a few things happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>The agent connects with the remote TeamServer</li>
<li>The agent starts sending data for the application</li>
<li>If licenses are available, details for the application are visible in TeamServer</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next section, we&rsquo;ll look at working with the Contrast Security User Interface running on TeamServer.</p>
</section>

<section data-noprocess data-shortcode-slide
      id="introduction-to-teamserver">
  
<h2 id="introduction-to-teamserver">Introduction to TeamServer</h2>
<p>There are several options to observe information about vulnerabilities in Contrast Security:</p>
<ul>
<li>The browser User Interface (UI)</li>
<li>Programmatic/Command-Line (CLI) API access</li>
<li>Via various integrations (Jira, Slack, IDEs, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;ll focus on both the UI and CLI options.</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>The dashboard is a landing page for all Contrast Security users - developers, operations, security, and administrators.  The different dashboard pages provide an overview for your team to quickly assess the status of the application security.</p>
</aside>
<h3 id="log-on-to-teamserver">Log on to TeamServer</h3>
<p>Start by logging onto the Contrast Security UI at <a href="https://eval.contrastsecurity.com">https://eval.contrastsecurity.com</a> with the username and password your instructor supplied to you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll use the default landing page&rsquo;s dashboard as the starting point for this module&rsquo;s exercise.</p>
<p>Your instructor will provide an overview of the TeamServer.</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>In this slide, we should have already setup each user with their running applications so data has been sent to TeamServer.</p>
<p>The time saved by automatically onboarding and offboarding applications is huge.  No more complex rules, setup, or configuration.</p>
</aside>
<h3 id="teamserver-notification">TeamServer Notification</h3>
<p>Click on the bell icon in the upper right-hand corner to see notifications alerting us to the automatic onboarding of our new server and application.</p>

<p>At the onset of this workshop, your instructor would have deployed vulnerable applications and configured them with an agent using your identity.  Your application is already onboarded on TeamServer, and this easy onboarding process works very well for teams constantly creating and deleting infrastructure.</p>
<p>At Contrast, we&rsquo;ve learned that as team shift more of their workload to ephemeral and cloud-based environments, automatic onboarding is a big time-saver.  This automatic registration lets teams automatically opt into a security model.</p>
</section><section>
<h3 id="teamserver-dashboard">TeamServer Dashboard</h3>
<p>Back to the main dashboard, you should see a summary about your deployed applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of Applications, Libraries and Servers</li>
<li>Average time to remediate vulnerabilties</li>
<li>Current vulnerabilities, listed by severity</li>
<li>Current attacks</li>

<h3 id="real-time-visibility">Real-Time Visibility</h3>
<p>As you and your teams onboard applications, their results will be added to Contrast Security for better visibility into the state of your application development in real time.</p>
<p>This screenshot is an example of a dashboard after a few hundred applications have been onboarded.</p>

<h3 id="ongoing-data-collection">Ongoing Data Collection</h3>
<p>From the onset, you accumulate results in TeamServer.  This is the first of many advantages of IAST, where your team&rsquo;s day-to-day exercising and testing automatically generates meaningful results of security vulnerabilities.  As you and your teams exercise more of your software, we&rsquo;ll keep track of new vulnerabilities and their remediation.</p>
<p>This means you can add Contrast Security to your existing workflow and start using results immediately.
There is high value to all members of your team when you can leverage this information with minimal configuration.</p>

      id="the-contrast-API">
  
<h2 id="the-contrast-api">The Contrast API</h2>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s look at how your teams can leverage the Contrast API.</p>
<p>The TeamServer User Interface is designed to help users find and see information quickly and easily.  The TeamServer utilizes an API on the backend, and Contrast Security has made this API available to external users.</p>
<p>Contrast Security provides a number of out-of-the-box integrations for Jira, Jenkins, Slack, and other popular tools to provide fast feedback.  Contrast Security also provides programmatic access for teams that wish to integrate with their existing systems.</p>
<p>You can also reference the Contrast Security [API documentation] (<a href="https://api.contrastsecurity.com">https://api.contrastsecurity.com</a>).</p>
</section><section>
<h3 id="api-overview">API Overview</h3>
<p>In this section, we&rsquo;ll show you how to programmatically access the same information via API.  We&rsquo;ll compare some of the results from the User Interface and the CLI to show consistency.</p>
<p>To programmatically use the API, you will need specific details to make them work.  We&rsquo;ll guide you in the next tasks with those details.</p>
<p>Real world teams will see familiar patterns and techniques in the Contrast API if they have used others.  Teams have taken great liberty using their favorite programming or scripting languages to automate against our API in their preferred toolchain.</p>
<p>The examples here will illustrate the basics.</p>
</section><section>
<h3 id="source-code-scripts">Source code: scripts</h3>
<p>At Contrast Security, we&rsquo;ve published our workshop files to GitHub so you can access the content there.  Let&rsquo;s start by getting the code for this project so you can run some script.  We&rsquo;ll assume you are always working from the same base directory as shown by the %HOMEPATH% reference below.</p>
<p>From your workstation, open a command prompt and run the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="nohighlight" data-noescape>cd %HOMEPATH%
git clone https://github.com/Contrast-Security-OSS/workshop
cd workshop
</code></pre></div><p>The command-line commands you will run will be from the checked out folder, named <code>workshop.</code></p>
</section><section>
<h3 id="your-application-id">Your Application ID</h3>
<p>The first piece of information we&rsquo;ll get is the unique Application ID for your running instance of WebGoat.  Every application has a unique identifier, and we&rsquo;ll find ours in the URL when we&rsquo;re on a page that shows your WebGoat application:</p>
<p><code>https://eval.contrastsecurity.com/Contrast/static/ng/index.html#/c992a0ef-e965-4f92-a410-e09256a78758/applications/2ac60539-9d58-4365-a006-dc0fc51efc7e</code></p>
<p>The two embedded IDs are identified as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>c992a0ef-e965-4f92-a410-e09256a78758</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The first value is your organization UUID, or <code>{org_uuid}</code>.  Your <code>{org_uuid}</code> is where you collect the details of your various applications specific to your organization.  In this case, the organization is made up of one user - you.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>2ac60539-9d58-4365-a006-dc0fc51efc7e</code>
The second value is your application ID, or<code>{app_id}</code>.  Your <code>{app_id}</code> is specific to your running instance of your WebGoat application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make note of the <code>app_id</code> because we&rsquo;ll need this later.</p>
</section><section>
<h3 id="user-api-details">User API details</h3>
<p>In TeamServer, Click on your name in the upper-right hand corner and then select &ldquo;Oragnization Settings&rdquo; to find your API details.</p>

<h3 id="generate-sample-api-request">Generate Sample API Request</h3>
<p>The last piece of information is your Authorization Key.  Click on the &ldquo;Generate Sample API Request&rdquo; button on the Rest API Details page.</p>
<p>The Authorization is the string of characters following the <code>-H 'Authorization:</code> text.  This Authorization value is necessary for REST API transactions.  You&rsquo;ll use this information in CLI, or your preferred programming environment.  This final piece is:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>{authorization_key}</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="setup-files">Setup files</h3>
<p>In this module, we provide helper scripts to make it easier for you to run commands.</p>
<p>Run this setup script to make things a little easier, where you will be prompted for these values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>{org_uuid}</code></li>
<li><code>{api_key}</code></li>
<li><code>{authorization_key}</code></li>
<li><code>{app_id}</code></li>
</ul>
<p>In the checkout directory (should be &ldquo;workshop&rdquo;), execute the following commands:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="nohighlight" data-noescape>cd %HOMEPATH%\workshop\scripts\module1
setup.bat
</code></pre></div><p>The setup script will prompt you for details to create helper scripts.  These helper scripts are meant to make it easier to run API commands.  The outputs will be scripts with the content you need.  You can always re-run <code>setup.bat</code> to reset your scripts.</p>
</section><section>
<h3 id="sample-api-request">Sample API Request</h3>
<p>If you navigate to Your Account-&gt;Profile, you&rsquo;ll see a button to &ldquo;Generate Sample API Requst.&rdquo;  This is a multi-line command suitable for Linux distributions, but not convenient for Windows environments.  The next page will help you with that command.</p>

<h3 id="third-party-software">Third-party Software</h3>



<aside class="notes"><p>Describe the value of being able to see third-party software</p>
</aside>
<p>When Contrast Security identifies third party components in your application, your teams want to know the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What third-party software are we including?</li>
<li>What third-party software are we using?</li>
<li>Are we in compliance with those third-party software components?</li>
</ul>
<p>Contrast Security identifies only those libraries that are actually loaded by the application into the runtime.  Traditional SCA tools typically report on all libraries, regardless of use.  This means Contrast Security helps your team stay more focused on only those libraries in actual use, saving valuable time.</p>
<p>Your team will want to automate processes to find details <em>interesting</em> to them.  Let&rsquo;s see how that works next.</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>In this screen, we highlight the virtues of being a DevOps-friendly solution because of our API access at the CLI, or your other tooling.
When your teams integrate Contrast Security into your toolchain using the same techniques as other solutions, you amplify your capabilities by being able to automate decisions and process with the RIGHT information.</p>
</aside>
<p>Below, we see two results.  The first JSON body is the summary of the vulnerabilities, indicating there are 24 of them.  The second JSON body retrieves the UUIDs of the individual vulnerabilities.  This is an example of how your team might create a workflow of API calls to get lists of information, and operate on them to fit your automation model.</p>

<h3 id="webgoat-sql-injecting-data-entry">WebGoat: SQL Injecting Data Entry</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s revisit a previous page and perform an actual SQL Injection string.  In the previous example, we entered a normal name and were alerted of the vulnerability.  Here, we&rsquo;ll do an actual attack.</p>
<p>In the box to enter your last name, enter the following typical SQL Injection text.  The application will announce you correctly performed a SQL Injection.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-protect-your-application-in-production">How to protect your application in production</h3>
<p>Contrast Security not only shifts security left but also extends it to the right and protect running applications in productions from being exploited due to known or unknown vulnerabilities. Contrast Security uses the same instrumentation, in the fact, the same agent to do this.</p>
</section><section>
<h3 id="contrast-protect-1">Contrast Protect</h3>
<p>Navigate to your Webgoat Application, and lok through the Attacks subpage.  You&rsquo;ll see an exploit on your application.  At the onset, Contrast Security only Monitors this specific vulnerability.  We will look at the policy and change it so Contrast Security is more active.</p>

<h3 id="teamserver-policies">TeamServer Policies</h3>



<aside class="notes"><p>Explain the value of policies and how they are applied to your organization as a pattern.  This is a time-saving capability that allows your teams to enable consistent and systematic approaches to your company&rsquo;s software security strategy.</p>
<p>Contrast Security provides default (Best practices) policies for your team as a start.  This helps your teams more quickly onboard the solution to be Contrast Ready.</p>
</aside>
<p>As you can see, Contrast Security is already protecting the application from exploiting most common vulnerabilities.  The image below has some filtering enabled so we can focus on SQL Injection.  You should notice the policy is to MONITOR in the development environment.  Change the polilcy to BLOCK.</p>

<h3 id="teamserver-protect---probed">TeamServer Protect - Probed</h3>
<p>We now have a new entry showing your application was attacked again, but the status is probed.  This is how Contrast Security lets you know that we detected a known SQL injection and stopped it.  Contrast reports the probe to your team, but the attacker receives a response that <em>does not</em> reveal the vulnerability.  This is very powerful because it shows how Contrast Security is able to protect your running applications against these types of attacks.</p>

</aside>
<p>In this hands-on example, you have seen how Contrast Security works with your application to reveal vulnerabilities during your testing, and how we protect your application at runtime.</p>
<p>We encourage you to try different attacks
Now you can try to exploit WebGoat again and see what happens.  Change some policies for your application, or try different exercises within WebGoat.</p>
<p>Your instructor will provide guidance as needed.</p>
