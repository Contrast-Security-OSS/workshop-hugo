      <description>Deploying your application This workshop is designed to have you deploy an application so you can see its data added as part of an onboarding lifecycle.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with the deployment of the docker container that contains already instrumented code. We have already configured your container with a Contrast Security agent plus details to point to the right TeamServer. Your task is to start this container with the running application and observe how it will automatically register with the server and start generating results.</description>
