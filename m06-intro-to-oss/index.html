<h2 id="what-is-open-source-and-what-is-open-source-software">What is Open Source and what is Open Source Software?</h2>
<p>The term Open Source refers to anything that people can modify and share because it’s design is publicly available.</p>
<p>Open Source Software or OSS (also sometimes referred to as Free and Open Source Software or FOSS) refers to any software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify and enhance.</p>
<p>An integral part of Open Source Software is the presence of a license.</p>
<p>Without a license, a piece of source code is not considered Open Source Software, in fact it can be anything; e.g., stolen commercial code. In fact physical source code in public access does not make it Open Source.</p>
<p>Typically an Open Source License declares that the source code in question is available to others who would like to view that code, copy it, learn from it, alter it, or share it.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-business-risks-associated-with-foss">What are the business risks associated with FOSS?</h3>
<p>Three classes of risk associated with FOSS are legal and security risks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Security risk is coming from publicly known vulnerabilities present in FOSS libraries as well as zero-day vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Legal risk originates from licenses which effectively declare terms of use of any given FOSS. Be mindful that absence of a license means that terms of use are unknown and hence represent even greater risk to the business.</li>
<li>Operational risk - which is coming from the old or obsolete FOSS components which are no longer maintained and potentially have multiple zero day vulnerabilities which outside of the public eye due to low popularity of these components or older versions of some of the more popular components</li>
</ul>
<p>Contrast Security OSS product can help you manage all of these risks.</p>

<aside class="notes"></aside>
<p>First thing you need is an instrumented application. You can take any application you have used in previous modules or onboard a new one, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/terracotta-bank/terracotta-bank">https://github.com/terracotta-bank/terracotta-bank</a>.</p>
<p>Once an application is onboarded, the list of libraries in the application is populated immediately and you can browse to <code>Applications &gt; [App Name] &gt; Libraries</code></p>

<p>On the screen shot below, you can find information about the library score (from A to F, where A is best and F is worst), library name, version you are using now (with release date), latest version (also with release date), and class usage information.</p>
<p>Contrast scores libraries based three factors: time, status, security. You can read more on library scoring here: <a href="https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/library-scoring-guide.html">https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/library-scoring-guide.html</a>.  The Libraries view allows you to quickly identify which OSS libraries may present some risk or vulnerabilities within your application.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-find-information-about-publicly-known-security-vulnerabilities-in-oss-you-use">How to find information about publicly known security vulnerabilities in OSS you use?</h3>
<p>First click on the funnel next to the &ldquo;Usage&rdquo; column title and enable/tick against &ldquo;Used&rdquo; checkbox
<figure>
    <img src="filter-used.png" height="150px"/> 
</figure>
</p>
<p>Then click on vulnerabilities drop down list which is on the left
<figure>
    <img src="vuln-ddl.png" height="150px"/> 
</figure>
</p>
<p>and choose &ldquo;Vulnerable&rdquo;, this will produce the list of libraries that contain publicly known security vulnerabilities

<h3 id="detailed-security-information-about-the-library">Detailed security information about the library</h3>
<p>If you click on the library name, you will get to a library page where you can find information on which applications are using this library, on which servers those applications are hosted, various other metadata, and most importantly, information about publicly known security vulnerabilities:</p>

<p>In very broad terms, legal risk originates from those license obligations which are unknown to your business and prevent you from licensing your code with terms that satisfy your business model.</p>
<p>In order to see what licenses were identified in your application, click the filter icon on the top and expand the list of licenses as necessary.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="licenses.png"

<h3 id="how-to-identify-oss-operational-risks-with-contrast">How to identify OSS operational risks with Contrast?</h3>
<p>On the main &ldquo;Libraries&rdquo; tab, release dates will help you quickly understand which libraries are out of date and should be updated to mitigate risk.</p>
<p>In addition to this, on the top right corner of the Library tab, click &ldquo;Show Library Status&rdquo;
<figure>
    <img src="show-library-status.png" height="94px"/> 
</figure>
</p>
<p>You will then see a graph similar to the one below depicting the age of the libraries that have been identified and how many are out-of-date.

<p>Contrast provides you with information about the number of classes loaded during the execution of your application, as well as, a list of loaded class names.</p>
<p>This information will help developers prioritize their remediation work (e.g. it makes sense to focus on the most used libraries with the largest number of vulnerabilities) or for example estimate the coverage of their applications.</p>
<p>To view enhanced class usage data, simply click on the number under the &ldquo;Usage&rdquo; column and you will be presented with the following view:
